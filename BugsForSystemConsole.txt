# Observable that is a more complex object / row that's a single Observable

# use the alternate thing that goes away on process exit?

# gridview doesn't make any sense.
* Is SetRows creating rows, or columns (by defining what makes up a row)?
Why doesn't this work?

```c#
            var grid = new GridView();

            grid.SetRows(
                RowDefinition.Star(1),
                RowDefinition.Fixed(10));

            grid.SetChild(new ContentView("0,0"), 0, 0);
            grid.SetChild(new ContentView("0,1"), 0, 1);

            screen.Child = grid;
            screen.Render();
```

# I want size constraints in StackView

# how do I get formatted text out of an Observable?
